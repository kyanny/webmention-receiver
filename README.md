# webmention-receiver

A [Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) receiver implementation for practice.

Only covers MUST specifications very roughly.

Not production ready, of course. Though it passes [webmention-testpinger](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-webmention-testpinger)'s test suites.

If you are looking for more practical Webmention receiver implementation, I recommend https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io or https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions.
