# webmention-receiver

A Webmention receiver implementation for practice.

Only covers MUST specifications very roughly.

Not production ready, of course.

If you are looking for more practical Webmention receiver implementation, I recommend https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io or https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions.
