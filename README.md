# webmention-receiver

A [Webmention](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) receiver implementation for practice. Demo deployment is https://immense-dusk-57047.herokuapp.com/.

Only covers MUST specifications very roughly.

Not production ready, of course, though it passes [webmention-testpinger](https://github.com/voxpelli/node-webmention-testpinger)'s test suites and receiver test [#1](https://webmention.rocks/receive/1) and [#2](https://webmention.rocks/receive/2) of [Webmention Rocks!](https://webmention.rocks/).

If you are looking for more practical Webmention receiver implementation, I recommend https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io or https://github.com/voxpelli/webpage-webmentions.

Special thanks to [Japanese translation of Webmention spec](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~ax2s-kmtn/internet/link/REC-webmention-20170112.html).
